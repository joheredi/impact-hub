# Personal Impact System

This document outlines the overall system, its principles, components, and rhythms.

---

## 1. Core Principles

1. **Focus on the 20%**  
   Concentrate on the top 2–3 objectives that drive the greatest impact.  

2. **Measure & Signal**  
   Attach clear metrics (uptime, performance gains, cost savings, customer wins) to every initiative.  

3. **Delegate & Grow**  
   Push teachable chunks of work to your team, aligned to their growth goals.  

4. **Ruthless Triage**  
   Adopt a simple filter—Align/Urgency/Effort—to decide what you own, what you defer, and what you drop.  

5. **Systematize Interaction**  
   Turn meetings and 1:1s into decision-focused rituals with pre-reads, agendas, and rapid follow-up.

## 2. System Components

### A) Impact Hub  
A single, living “source of truth” doc that captures:
- **Objectives & Key Results**  
- **Active Initiatives & Roadmap**  
- **Delegation Board**  
- **Meeting Notes & Action Items**  
- **People Scorecards**

### B) Intake & Triage  
1. **Capture Every Ask**  
   Funnel every commitment (email, chat, calendar) into an “Inbox/Intake.”  
2. **Quick-Scan Tags**  
   - **Align**: A (top-3), B (org-wide), C (nice-to-have)  
   - **Urgency**: 1 (this week), 2 (this quarter), 3 (later)  
   - **Effort**: S (< 2 hr), M (< 1 day), L (> 1 day)  
3. **ROI Scoring**  
   `ROI = (Align×Urgency) ÷ Effort` → Bucket into:  
   - **Own Now** (high ROI)  
   - **Delegate** (medium ROI)  
   - **Defer/Automate** (low ROI, recurring)  
   - **Decline/Drop** (lowest ROI)

### C) Delegation Framework  
For each task to delegate, create a “Delegation Card” capturing:
1. **Context & Why It Matters** (ties to OKR/customer)  
2. **Outcome & Success Criteria** (“what done looks like”)  
3. **Boundaries & Autonomy** (decision rights, non-negotiables)  
4. **Resources & Dependencies** (links, people)  
5. **Check-In Cadence** (schedule a mid-point sync)

Match tasks to engineers based on their **People Scorecards** (strengths, goals, readiness).

### D) People Scorecards  
Maintain a mini-profile for each direct report:
- **Core Role & Tenure**  
- **Strengths & Expertise**  
- **Development Goals (Next Quarter)**  
- **Competency Ratings** (Technical, Collaboration, Communication, Autonomy, Leadership)  
- **Delegation Readiness** (1–5)  
- **Current Assignments & Capacity**  
- **Recent Wins & Feedback**

Use them to assign tasks that both serve the team and grow individuals.

### E) Meeting Optimization  
Turn every recurring sync or 1:1 into a lean decision meeting:
1. **Before**: Publish a 1-bullet agenda and data links 24 hrs prior.  
2. **During**: Start on time, restate purpose, time-box items, assign owners + due dates.  
3. **After**: Post a 1-bullet summary, update the Impact Hub, set reminders for action items.

### F) Daily & Weekly Cadence  
- **Daily**:  
  - Morning (15 min): Quick reset—capture new asks, glance at top 3 goals.  
  - Deep Focus Blocks (2× 2 hr): Blue-sky design, critical coding, or mentoring.  
  - Office Hours (30 min): Batch questions, update FAQ/wiki.  
- **Weekly (15 min)**:  
  - Run a “Weekly Review”—groom Intake, delegate/defer, update KR % and metrics, draft “This Week’s Impact.”  
- **Monthly (30 min)**:  
  - Deep dive on OKRs vs metrics, retire low-value work, plan next month, update scorecards.

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

1. **Pick Your Tools**  
   Any doc platform (OneNote, Confluence, Markdown repo, Org-mode) works—what matters is structure and ritual.  

2. **Structure Your Hub**  
   Create top-level sections for Intake, OKRs, Initiatives, Delegations, Meetings, and Archive.  

3. **Automate What You Can**  
   - Link to dashboards (Power BI, Grafana) for live metrics.  
   - Use calendar appointments to reserve focus blocks and ritual times.  

4. **Enforce Meeting Best Practices**  
   - Always share a brief agenda ahead.  
   - Keep recurrences minimal; merge overlapping calls.  
   - Move status drills to shared docs or async threads.

5. **Review & Adapt**  
   - After each week/month ask: which 20% of activities drove 80% of the impact?  
   - Adjust tags, triage thresholds, and rhythms accordingly.
